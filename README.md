# 🔍 Real-Time Fraud Detection Pipeline

> **Kafka → Spark Structured Streaming → Graph Neural Network → SHAP Explainability**

A production-style, end-to-end real-time fraud detection system. Streams live transactions through a heterogeneous **Graph Neural Network (HeteroGraphSAGE)** trained on the IEEE-CIS dataset, with per-decision SHAP explainability and a live Streamlit dashboard.

##  Setup

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fraud-detection-pipeline.git
cd fraud-detection-pipeline
```

### 2. Install Docker Desktop

Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).  
On Windows, **enable WSL 2** when prompted.

### 3. Get the dataset

Download the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle:  
👉 https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data

Place the files in the `data/` folder:
```
data/
├── train_transaction.csv
└── train_identity.csv
```

### 4. Create a Python virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If PyTorch Geometric fails, install manually:
```bash
pip install torch==2.1.0
pip install torch-geometric==2.4.0
pip install torch-scatter torch-sparse -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.0+cpu.html
```

##  Run Order

Open a **separate terminal** for each step.

#### Step 1 - Start infrastructure
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Wait ~30 seconds, then verify:
- Spark UI → http://localhost:8080
- Kafka → `docker ps` (all containers should be `healthy`)

#### Step 2 - Build the transaction graph *(one-time)*
```bash
python graph/graph_builder.py
```
Loads the IEEE-CIS CSVs, builds the heterogeneous account-merchant-email graph, and saves to `models/graph_data.pt`. Takes 2–5 minutes.

#### Step 3 - Train the GNN *(one-time)*
```bash
python training/train_gnn.py
```
Trains HeteroGraphSAGE for 50 epochs. Saves:
- `models/gnn_model.pt` - best checkpoint
- `models/training_curves.png` - loss + AUC plots
- `models/test_results.json` - final test metrics

Takes 10–30 minutes on CPU (faster with GPU).

#### Step 4 - Start the Kafka producer
```bash
python producer/kafka_producer.py --mode fast       # for testing
python producer/kafka_producer.py --mode realistic  # for demo
python producer/kafka_producer.py --mode burst      # for stress testing
```
Expected output: `Produced 1000 / 590540 transactions`

#### Step 5 - Start the streaming pipeline
```bash
python pipeline/streaming_pipeline.py
```
Expected output: `Batch 0 done - 47 txns | 2 flagged | 94 txns/sec`

Results are written to `outputs/results/` as JSONL files.

#### Step 6 - Launch the dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```
Open browser at: http://localhost:8501

##  Stopping Everything

```bash
# Ctrl+C in the pipeline and producer terminals, then:
docker-compose down
```

##  Troubleshooting

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `No brokers available` | Kafka isn't ready. Wait 30s after `docker-compose up` and retry. |
| `Graph not found` | Run `python graph/graph_builder.py` before the pipeline. |
| `CUDA out of memory` | Training uses CPU by default. If using GPU, set `SPARK_MASTER = "local[*]"` in `config.py`. |
| `train_transaction.csv not found` | Download from Kaggle (Step 3 above). |
| `Dashboard shows no data` | The `outputs/results/` directory is empty - run Steps 4 and 5 first. |
| High memory usage | In Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources, set memory to 6 GB minimum. |

##  Tech Stack

| Component | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Event streaming | Apache Kafka | Durable, replayable, high-throughput event log |
| Stream processing | PySpark Structured Streaming | Stateful windowed velocity features at scale |
| Graph ML | PyTorch Geometric (GraphSAGE) | Captures fraud ring structure across accounts |
| Explainability | SHAP + GNNExplainer | Regulatory compliance (GDPR Art. 22, SR 11-7) |
| Dashboard | Streamlit | Rapid, Python-native UI |
| Containerization | Docker Compose | Reproducible local infrastructure |
| Dataset | IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection | Real-world finance data (~590K transactions) |

##  Design Decisions

**Why Kafka over a simple queue?**  
Kafka's durable offset tracking allows any consumer to replay the full transaction log from any point - critical for fraud auditing and pipeline recovery.

**Why GNN over XGBoost?**  
Fraud often involves rings of connected accounts sharing merchants, IPs, and email domains. A heterogeneous GNN learns these latent structural patterns that hand-engineered features miss entirely.

**Why SHAP?**  
Financial institutions are subject to GDPR Article 22 (right to explanation) and SR 11-7 model risk governance. SHAP provides per-transaction, per-feature attribution that satisfies both.

**Path to production:**  
Replace the CSV Kafka producer with a real card-network feed → swap `local[*]` Spark with a cluster → add PSI-based model drift monitoring → implement an automated retraining pipeline.
